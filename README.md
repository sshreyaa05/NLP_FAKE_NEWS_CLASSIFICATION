### Fake News Classification Using LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and GRU

### Short Description:
This project focuses on classifying fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with deep learning modelsâ€”LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and GRU. The dataset underwent text preprocessing, including Keras tokenization and sequencing of data to prepare it for training. We then split the dataset into train and test sets and implemented the three models. After evaluation, Bidirectional LSTM outperformed the other models, achieving the highest test accuracy, making it the most effective model for detecting fake news.

### Results:

a. Bidirectional LSTM achieved the highest test accuracy, making it the best-performing model.

b. LSTM and GRU also performed well but were slightly less accurate than Bidirectional LSTM.

c. Text preprocessing, tokenization, and sequencing significantly improved model performance by ensuring structured input for deep learning models.
